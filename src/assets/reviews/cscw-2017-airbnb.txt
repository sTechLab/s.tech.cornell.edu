Self-Disclosure and Perceived Trustworthiness of Airbnb Host Profiles

This work presents an thoughtful analysis of trust in an online marketplace. The reviewers have provided a set of incredibly insightful reviews and suggestions. Overall this paper is a good contribution to the conference. The authors have addressed most of the issues raised in the first round. 

However, there is one issue in particular that was deemed important to resolve before the final version of the paper. The issue is the dismissal of the data from 3 cities. The authors explained that they removed them because they are  preparing the dataset for a computational large scale analysis and cultural differences between cities, not yet done in this paper." However, the reviewers do not feel that this is a satisfactory answer. This issue was discussed at the PC meeting and the agreement was that the paper will need to make sure to add a few sentences on explaining in detail and in a more nuanced way the reasons for the removal of these data. I would suggest to add them up front as part of the limitations. Once you address this, the paper will be all set for publication.
