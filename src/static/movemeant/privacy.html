	<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are two things you should keep in mind as you read it:</br>
</br>

These services include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</br>
Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.</br>
</br>
We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope youâ€™ll let us know.</br>
</br>
<b>Information We Collect and Receive</b></br>

Information you give us. You can give us information directly. For example:</br>
</br>

</br>
